  <h2>THE GUIDE TO CRUISE JOBS</h2>
  <p><strong>A few days ago a friend asked me how i had come to secure a job on a cruise.Well most people think its hard to be hired onboard,but im here to tell you it isn't.See,you have to have <i><b>experience</b></i> in your chosen field of interest, as recruiters mostly look for experience in their selected candidates.Dont get me wrong,having a certificate or a degree is an advantage as some positions will require some form of post high school training or certification. .</strong></p>

    <p>Firstly,Google should be your best bet in searching for anything including cruise job links.Have an idea of the job requirements before creating your cv and applying.Nowadays there  is a  computer software (ATS) which specifically looks for certain keywords in order for it to select your cv.Trust me,if those keywords are not there you wont make the cut.So cv writing is also key to the job search process.</p>
